# C for grown kids

The revolutionary programming language. At least it's how
people see it, I suppose. What's so special about it, after all?
Well, it's not a pocket assembly, as some people may think. Neither is C
a complex language, it's pretty small, actually. And as such, writing code
became somewhat an easier task for that time. So let's see if C is really
a nice language, or if it's just as evil as everything else.

I'm not going to explain basic semantics, like functions, variables, control flow
and the like. Rather, I'll go through some concepts and implement interesting
programs using what C has to offer us.

## C is small, so is your patience

Of course, C isn't as easy to learn as drinking water. Coding with
pointers, for example, is pure hell. Not screwing design up is also difficult.
That said, don't assume you're not going through stress. As time goes by, you will learn
to think of a problem as pieces, decomposing it all, thereby solving each one by writing
code and finally composing them back. This, as to any problem, applies to every language.
C is one of them, and that's what we're going to see in this course.

## What if we gave C steroids?

Of course, C has its weaks, and it misses a lot of modern paradigms.
C++, however, is something people think is the *new Câ„¢*. That's wrong. It's a completely
different language, regarding all of its aspects. You may not know what SFINAE means or what
it is for, for example. Many people don't like C++ because of how the language has evolved.
It's sad, however, that they only think the difference is just OOP. OOP isn't even the main
paradigm in C++, although the market loves to use it a lot.

Well, why am I saying all of this, you ask? We're going to focus on C, yes, only thing
is that C++ will be here for comparsion purpose. Don't be afraid, I won't bring C++'s deepest
dark magic.

## Are we implementing something?

Yes. The main algorithms will be a simple compiler (this brings
tons of interesting concepts), unix utilities, and some random machine code analysis. At the end,
probably you'll know enough C (and maybe some C++ tricks) to write code on your own (at least, that's
what I expect from you).

## I'm lost. Where can I find documentation?

A well written C and C++ reference is [en.cppreference.com](http://en.cppreference.com/). It's possible
to search for functions, libraries (see how they're probably implemented) and read about some caveats. It's
also important to note that you're going to use it very often. Don't try to memorize stuff right away.
Only practice can give you better knowledge.
